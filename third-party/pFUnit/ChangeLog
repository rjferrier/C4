04/07/2007 
	* Release astg_internal_0p2 added/corrected examples.  All should work and have
	  at least minimal directions.
	
04/06/2007 
	* Release astg_internal_0p1 created for use for group project.
	
11/02/2005 
	       * Added support for automatically wrapping MPI tests into test suites.
	       * Improved formatting for reporting failure messages from MPI tests.

10/16/2005  FUnit 1.0 (cvs tag funit-1p0)
	* MPI portability has been significantly enhanced - special thanks
	  to Spencer Swift for his efforts in this direction.  This
	  release should work with Altix, Tru64, and OSX with IBM
	  compiler.
	
         * MPI test cases can now optionally use fixture/setup/teardown.
	Use of new/delete methods is mandatory, since the launch mechanism
	has now means to transfer object handles between the driver and
	the MPI procs.
	
        * An initial attempt at automatically assembling a test suite and
	driver executable from user provided tests is now in place in the
	./auto directory.  There is a great deal of functionality there,
	but the scripts are rather messy and have little documentation.
	MPI tests cases are _not_ yet supported there - mostly because
	I've not decided how to determine the number of processors to run
	the test on.

08/09/2005	FUnit 0.9 (cvs tag funit-0p9) 
	        * Beta testing of FUnit begins within SIVO/ASTG
	        * Cleaned up demo directory such that there is a separate
	          sub directory for each demo.
	        * Repared bug in MPI_TestCase related to passing arrays of strings
	          to MPI.  FUnit should now be portable to IBM/Tru64/MipsPro/Intel compilers.
