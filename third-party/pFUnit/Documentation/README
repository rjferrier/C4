This purpose is to generate the PDF files for the documentations including 
the User's Guide and API documentations.

Before you start to build via 'make', ensure that the tool 'pdflatex' and 
'doxygen' are added to the PATH environment variable.  Otherwise, you will
get the error message.

The following command for building the documentation:

% make all

After building is successful, there are the following outputs:

./UserGuide/UserGuide.pdf
./API/html
./API/latex
./API/ReferenceManual.pdf


For removing those output files and directories, the following command is:

% make distclean
