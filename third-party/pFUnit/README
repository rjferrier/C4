Currently supported architectures:

	  OS	    Arch    Fortran	MPI

	  Darwin    i386    Intel	OpenMPI
	  Darwin    i386    G95		---
	  Linux	    x86_64  Intel	Scali
	  Linux	    ia64    Intel      	MPT (Altix)

Ports to these once worked, but are not regularly verified:
	  Darwin    ppc	    NAG		---
	  Darwin    ppc	    IBM		LAM
	  Darwin    ppc	    G95		---
	  CPQ		    Tru64	native
	  Irix		    MIPS	MPT

To build pFUnit and internal tests:
   % make all [MPI=YES] [DSO=YES]

MPI is optional, due to the fact that some environments do not support MPI.
(E.g. login nodes on the local mainframes.)  DSO is also optional because
portability is problematic.

To compile pFUnit internal tests and execute them:
   % make tests

To override the default compiler use
  % make tests [F90_Vendor=<vendor name>]

eg

  % make tests F90_Vendor=NAG

---

To install the pFUnit files that are needed externally (scripts, libs, and .mod files):

% make install INSTALL_DIR=<path>
