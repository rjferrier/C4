To build and run these examples, you must specify a handful of
environment variables:

F90      - name of F90 compiler command
MPIF90 - name of MPIf90 compiler command
F90FLAGS - additional flags needed to compile (e.g. IBM xlf needs to be told about .F90 extensions)
LDFLAGS  - additonal flags for the load step  (e.g. -lmpi might be needed for some MPI installations)

Depending on the system and the set of tests to be run, you may also
need to specify the load path for dynamic libraries to include the
pFUnit library directory.  On must unix systems (using the bash
shell), this looks like:

% export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$PFUNIT/lib

On Macintosh, the environment variable is actually "DYLD_LIBDRARY_PATH":

% export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:$PFUNIT/lib

In each subdirectory, you should be able to simply type make and run the executable.
The executables are all of the form "*.x"
